# time-series-forecasting
This repository implements **Neural ODEs** in **PyTorch** and using **torchdiffeq** to model weather dynamics instead of predicting values directly. It learns differential equations for better generalization and extrapolation, outperforming **LSTMs** in capturing long-term trends.
